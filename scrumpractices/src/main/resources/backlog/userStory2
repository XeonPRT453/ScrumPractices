Title:Refactoring: Using Chain of Responsibility design pattern to improve flexibility of code

Motivation to Refactor:
Encapsulate the processing elements inside a "pipeline" abstraction; and have clients "launch and leave" their requests at the entrance
to the pipeline.


Pattern: By using Chain of Responsibility design pattern, we can decouple sender and receiver and improve ability of maintenance.
