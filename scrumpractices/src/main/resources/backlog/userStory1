Title:Refactoring: Using Strategy design pattern to reduce complexity of code

Motivation to Refactor:
When inheriting parent class, we have to rewrite methods that are different for child class.
By using this pattern, we can dynamically change the status of object at run time.
The pattern also allows you to eliminate code duplication. It separates behavior from super and subclasses.


Pattern: By using Strategy design pattern, we can improve the flexibility of object and make project more maintainable.
